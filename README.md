# DataGrocer

Created "DataGrocer," a dynamic Svelte web application, as a university project. Used PostgreSQL on AWS to store and manage ABS data on grocery prices. Delivered user-friendly features for accessible insights, smooth interaction, and in-depth analysis, catering to academic researchers and market analysts. Successfully aligned with initial requirements, providing a valuable tool for understanding Australian grocery price trends.
