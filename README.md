# DataGrocer

Created "DataGrocer," a dynamic Svelte web application, as a university project. Used PostgreSQL on AWS to store and manage ABS data on grocery prices. Delivered user-friendly features for accessible insights, smooth interaction, and in-depth analysis, catering to academic researchers and market analysts. Successfully aligned with initial requirements, providing a valuable tool for understanding Australian grocery price trends.

Collaborated with a team of four—Marcus Fox, Minjih Kim, Carter Chin, and Putu Sari—over two semesters to develop "DataGrocer." The initial semester involved extensive planning, topic selection, and crafting project proposal reports. The subsequent semester focused on implementation, resulting in a dynamic Svelte web application utilizing PostgreSQL on AWS for efficient data management. The team's combined efforts successfully translated initial ideas into a practical tool for analyzing and comprehending grocery price trends in Australia.
