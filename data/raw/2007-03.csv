CAUTION: The average prices in this publication are presented for the purposes of making price comparisons between the capital cities for individual items. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is not appropriate to add together these items as no supporting information is provided on the relative importance of the items in the spending patterns of the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
households in each city. It is also not appropriate to compare item prices over time as the specifications and quality of items actually priced vary from period to period.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Comparisons over time of prices for the range of products consumed by households are provided by the CPI.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
